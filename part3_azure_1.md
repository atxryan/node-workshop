# Microsoft Azure and the Azure CLI
## Microsoft Azure
Microsoft Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform. At a high level it provides two things:

### Compute
Deploy your application workloads to public / private cloud and let them run in Microsoft Azure. We support multiple models including:
* Infrastructure As a Service [IAAS] through Virtual Machines
* Platform As a Service [PAAS] via Web sites and Cloud Services
* Backend As a Service [BAAS] via Azure Mobile Services. Node is supported in ALL :-)

### Services
Capabilities provided by Microsoft Azure that you can use within your applications whether they are running on premise or in the cloud
* Storage Services (Tables, Blobs, SQL)
* Messaging (Queues and Service Bus)
* Media Services, CDN, etc.
* Add-ons, 3rd part services like MongoDB, Pusher

# Azure CLI
A cross platform command line tool for managing Microsoft Azure Compute and Services

## Installing
The azure-cli is available as an npm package.

```bash
sudo npm install azure-cli -g
```

## Test it out
```bash
azure
```

## Downloading your credentials (publishsettings)

```bash
azure account download
```

This will take you to the Azure portal to login and download a publish settings file.

## Importing credentials

```bash
azure account import [publishsettings]
```

You should change to the directory where the publishsettings file was downloaded. Once you have imported you are now ready to go work with Azure.

## Test it out

```bash
azure site list
azure vm list
azure sb namespace list
azure sql list
```

## Head to the Azure portal!

```bash
azure portal
```
